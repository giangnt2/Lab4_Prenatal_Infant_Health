```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
setwd("C:/Users/TruongGiang/OneDrive/Work documents/MIDS Berkeley/W203-1/lab_4/Lab4_Prenatal_Infant_Health")
load("bwght_w203.RData")
summary(data)
ls()
plot(data$bwght, data$npvis)

```

Note: 
1. We will spend time on Exploratory Data Analysis to understand each variables, possible transformation, whether we should create a new variable
2. We will put different hypothesises about whether a particular variable should be included, does it help (Evaluate Bias Variance trade off analysis)
3. Key output:  Produce 3 candidate models that meet the requirement
4. Test CLM assumptions
5. Model spec presentation including standard error and statistical and practical significance 
6.6, 7 quetion can be done later.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
